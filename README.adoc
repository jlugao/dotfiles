== Basics

The environment works with Zsh, Vim and Tmux. Since everything is very new,
I am taking notes so that I can remember or review how to use everything.
More detailed notes should be present on specific pages.

=== Vim

- We are using neovim, because it has async functionality and we can use COC,
a auto complete that relies on vscode language servers.
